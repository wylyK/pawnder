# Development

Get start with developing Pawnder.

## Install dependencies

### Frontend

This app uses `npm` for frontend development. To install dependencies, go the the frontend directory of the project and use the following command:

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Backend

This app uses `pip` for backend development. To install dependencies, go the the backend directory of the project and use the following command:

```sh
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Setting Up Environment Variables

To ensure the app works correctly, you must configure .env files for both the frontend and backend. These files provide the necessary environment variables.

### Frontend .env File

In the frontend directory, create a .env file with the following content:

```sh
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL="http://127.0.0.1:5000"
```
This sets the backend API URL for the frontend during development.

### Backend .env File

In the backend directory, create a .env file with the following content:

```sh
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=pawnder-firebase-adminsdk.json
FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIzaSyAtmPYrMrZ2l2QEMDQ44YjQeKUX-CuUz9A
FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=pawnder-3a450.firebaseapp.com
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=pawnder-3a450
FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=pawnder-3a450.appspot.com
FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=508962509505
FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:508962509505:web:99633ada34ddc4e187ba40
FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-Y3NMKEVSMD
```
Ensure the file pawnder-firebase-adminsdk.json (used by GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS) is placed in the backend directory. This file is critical for Firebase operations.

## Login Credentials for Testing

To test the app, use the following login credentials:

Pet Owner login: `testuser@gmail.com` / `123456`
Vet login: `vet@gmail.com` / `123asd`

## Setup backend

This project uses Flask for the backend. You need to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies and run the backend.

### 1. Install `virtualenv`

First, you need to install the `virtualenv` package:

```sh
pip install virtualenv
```

### 2. Create new Virtural Environment

```sh
python -m venv ${VIRTUAL_ENV_NAME}
```

```sh
python -m venv venv
```

If the virtual environment name is different from venv, add it to the `.env` file for consistency.

### 3. Activate virtualenv

```Window
${VIRTUAL_ENV_NAME}\Scripts\activate
```

```Mac
source ${VIRTUAL_ENV_NAME}/bin/activate
```

## Run development mode

To begin running development mode:

### Frontend:

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Backend:

```sh
flask run
```

If live reloading isnâ€™t working

```sh
flask --app app run --debug
```

## Development workflow

Before starting your work, create a new branch (or an issue, then create a branch for it). Run:
Run `git fetch origin`
Run `git checkout -b ${YOUR_NEW_BRANCH}`
Ensure all dependencies are installed in the respective frontend and backend directories

As you (and other developers) make changes to the code base, there are some steps you should do before create a pull request (PR). At the directory of the project, run the following command to format code consistently: `npx prettier . --write`. Currently, CI/CD workflows are configured to check CSS formatting, TypeScript formatting, indentation, and syntax in the frontend.

Then, run `git add .` to stage your changes
Next, run `git commit -m ${YOUR_MESSAGE}` to commit with a descriptive message
Next, run `git pull origin main`
Next, run `git push origin ${YOUR_BRANCH}`

Before merging, request a code review from other team members to ensure code quality and alignment with project standards.
